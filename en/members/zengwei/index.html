<blockquote>
<p>Zeng Wei, born in 1985, Ph.D., associate professor, master’s tutor, was awarded the title of “Outstanding Student of Chengdian University” by Electronic Science and Technology University in 2014 (the highest honor of students of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China). He has been a reviewer for IEEE Transaction on Multimedia, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (EAAI), Scientific Reports, etc., and has received the “Outstanding Contribution in Reviewing” award from EAAI Journal. He has published more than 20 academic papers, applied for 5 patents, presided over 2 Sino-Swiss science and technology cooperation projects, presided over one National Natural Youth Fund, and presided over one National Natural Science Foundation project, and jointly reported the final assembly with CLP 10 Project 1, hosted a number of horizontal projects.</p>

<h2 id="Research_areas">Research areas</h2><p>The main research directions of my research group include: personalized recommendation technology, theoretical research and application of point process and application of big data technology in the financial field.</p>
<ol>
<li>Personalized recommendation technology. Aiming at the sparseness and cold start of the recommendation system, a local random walk algorithm and a matrix decomposition algorithm based on social network are proposed respectively. For the problem that the recommendation algorithm is less efficient, the topology of the recommended network is studied, and the information core and information are proposed. The recommendation algorithm of the skeleton; for the data sparsity problem of the multi-dimensional scoring recommendation system, the recommendation algorithm based on the scoring implicit component and the recommendation algorithm based on the migration learning are respectively proposed; the application of deep learning in the recommendation system is proposed, and the hybrid neural network is proposed. The recommended algorithm for the network. Related research results are published in Expert Systems with Applications, ICDM, Scientific Reports, Knowledge and Information Systems, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, and the like.</li>
<li>Theoretical research and application of the point process. The application of Poisson process, survival analysis and Hawkes process in user modeling is studied, and the influence of price factors, social factors and user preference factors on user regression time is considered. The fault diagnosis and prediction of electronic equipment based on point process is studied and applied to the avionics system of a large aircraft.</li>
<li>The application of big data technology in the financial field. In order to solve the problem of bank risk customer identification, deep learning is used to automatically identify and diagnose risk customers, and predict customers’ default behavior in advance. In view of the difficulty in marketing of bank customers, combined with a variety of personalized recommendation techniques, and using migration learning methods, we design a personalized marketing plan for each bank customer. Relevant research results were published in such journals as Big Data.</li>
